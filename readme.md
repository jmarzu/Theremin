#Weekend Front-end Hackathon

###Learn something new and build something cool in a weekend.

Your assignment for this weekend is to learn a new front-end library and build something **cool**. A big part of being a developer is being able to adapt and learn new technologies on your own. Below is a list of libraries that we think are interesting, but feel free to find something completely different (just nothing we've already learned).

##Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * `npm start` - start the BrowserSync server
  * `npm run lint:css` - lint CSS
  * `npm run lint:js` - lint JS

####Optional: Using SASS

* `gem install sass` - install the SASS gem
* Create a folder called `scss` in the root of the project
  * Create a `scss` file within this folder, such as `style.scss`
* Compile the files in the `scss` folder by running `scss scss:css`
  * `scss` defines the input folder, `css` defines the output folder
  * Use the `--watch` flag to watch for changes. Example: `scss --watch scss:css`

##Requirements

* Fork and clone this repository
* Use an external JavaScript library to create a website of your choice
* Focus on front-end
    * Make something visually interesting
    * Make something you'd be proud to show to others
* Commit and push to Github frequently 

Don't worry about a back-end for this project. Your project will probably just be an HTML file, some CSS, and some JavaScript (no Rails or Node needed).

##Tips

- Always remember, _"good artists copy, great artists steal."_ Look at other websites and apps that you think are designed well and learn from them. Obviously don't make a direct copy, but derive inspiration from those who design well.
- Check out site websites like:
  - [Adobe kuler](https://kuler.adobe.com/) - to see popular color schemes and figure out what colors go well with each other
    - while you are there, learn about the basics of [color theory](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437) - it is an __essential__ skill if you want to do front-end design/development  
  - [subtlepatters](http://subtlepatterns.com/), to find cool patterns for your backgrounds  
  - [iconfinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) - for some good looking icons for your project
  - [behance](https://www.behance.net/search?field=102) - to see what people are designing and what the community thinks
  - [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)

##Bonus

Make more pages and experiment more! Take inspiration from [Jennifer Dewalt](https://jenniferdewalt.com/), an engineer who made 180 different sites in 180 days.
